# Zube in General

> Zube adalah papan kanban Agile yang dirancang untuk pengembang (developer), manajer masalah yang kuat untuk pemimpin tim, tiket untuk dukungan pelanggan, sprint, dan analisis. Semua data dapat disinkronkan dengan GitHub secara real-time.


## Features

> * **Projects**
>  Projects are the highest level containers in Zube. You attach one or more data sources (GitHub Repositories) to a Project and that defines what information you can manage within the Project. Projects are made up of Workspaces, the Issue Manager, and Tickets, all of which are described in more detail below. A project also allows you to control which team members have access to your data. Only your team members that are project users will be able to view the components of a Project. Project admins can add or remove project users or make other users a project admin. A list of your Projects can be found on the Zube homepage, after you sign in. If you do not currently belong to any Projects, there will be a form that allows you to create your first Project.
> To create a Project, enter a name for your Project, select a GitHub organization, and select one or more source repositories to add to your project. Note that a particular source can only belong to a single project on Zube. If you need to share sources between teams, you should add all the sources you want to share to a single project. If you then need to separate out work items into separate boards, you can use Workspaces for that. Once you submit your new Project, Zube will automatically import the issues from the source repositories, turn those issues into Zube cards and generate a Workspace for your Project. Once the import is finished, you'll be redirected to your Workspace Kanban board.
> 
> * **Workspaces**
> Workspaces allow you break apart your cards into separate spaces. Workspaces contain a Kanban board, Sprint board, Sprints, and Burndown charts. Each project has at least one Workspace, but you can create multiple Workspaces for your Project. Every Workspace on a Project will have access to the same source repositories that have been added to the Project. However, cards can only exist on one Workspace at a time, which allows you to segment your cards as appropriate. Cards can be moved between Workspaces so you can create a workflow across different teams.
